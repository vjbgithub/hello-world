This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Veronica Bendixen. I have been unemployed since January 17, 2024. I have worked in IT and Data Analyst since 1985. My last 18 years I have been working in Healthcare keeping hospital HCIS up to date. I feel like I have pigeon-holed my self and need to upgrade my IT skills to be more up to date.
